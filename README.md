# Connect-4-NEW
This program runs a game of Connect 4 between two human players. The program asks the first and second players for their names and then prints out the initial game board (a 2D array with 6 rows and 7 columns) and each empty space in the game board is represented with a ".". Player one's game pieces are represented by "r"s and player two's game pieces are represented by "b"s. Each player is asked which column they want their game piece to be dropped down. The player must enter a number between 1 and 7 and the column must still have room for another game piece. If not, the user will continue to be promoted for a valid column number. After each player enters their column choice, the 2D array is updated and the new version of the game board is printed out. The game will continue until one player wins by getting four game pieces in a row either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally or until the entire game board is full and the game ends in a draw/tie. After the game is over, the program prints out which player won or draw if the game ended in a draw/tie along with the final version of the game board.
